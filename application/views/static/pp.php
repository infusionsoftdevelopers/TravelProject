                                <p class="text-justify">Personal information is information that relates to an identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is someone that can be identified both directly and indirectly by their name, location data, identification number or by factors specific to the social, cultural, physiological, genetic, mental or economic identity of the natural person. Personal Information does not include any information that has been anonymised so that it can no longer be used to identify a natural person.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">When you use our travel services, we do collect some personal information from you and any devices you use. Personal identifying information can include your name, telephone numbers, address, email addresses and financial information such as card details. Provision of any other personal information is voluntary on your account, but it may become necessary in order to use some of our services.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">We automatically collect information about your interaction with our website and communications with us.
